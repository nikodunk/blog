      <description>The problem I live in San Francisco, and our city beach is exactly 4.7 miles away from my apartment in Haight (yay!). It&#39;s a beautiful bike ride, but it&#39;s slightly further than I can bike with my board under my arm (boo). I either have to rely on my friend Jake (who has a car), or take the N-Line on Muni which is unreliable (especially on weekends) (boo!).
Or a bike rack?</description>
