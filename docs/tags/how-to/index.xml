      <description>A note on technical legacy What is lasting in the tech world? Architects build things that stay forever. Technologists build things that a week later doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because npm install&amp;rsquo;s libraries have changed.

Blockchain, because it is shared by all, may be a solution to this issue of splitting useful (but ephemeral) &amp;ldquo;built&amp;rdquo; software projects from capitalistic cycles, and allow them to be guaranteed to be run forever, as everyone is running them.</description>

Because most of the world lives in urbanized areas where renting is common, I think this is a problem standing in the way of solar adoption.</description>
