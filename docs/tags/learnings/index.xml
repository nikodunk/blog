      <title>How to set up Heroku SSL with Google Domains in 2019</title>
      <link>https://nikodunk.com/heroku-ssl-google-domains-2019/</link>

      <description>Ugh. This wastes time every time I run into it. It&amp;rsquo;s so much easier with AWS, and there&amp;rsquo;s terrible and conflicting documentation out on the web about Heroku, Google Domains and Heroku&amp;rsquo;s ACM for SSL. IF you do everything right, it&amp;rsquo;s actually very simple. So I&amp;rsquo;ll document how it worked for me in 2019 here as much for me as for anyone else.
I strongly reference David Gagne&amp;rsquo;s article here, which is now sometimes behind a paywall on Medium.</description>

      <title>December 2018 Update</title>

      <description>Month 2: Still laser-focused on writing code and talking to users, but now have found a good potential co-founder, brainstormed a new, bigger problem with him (important!) and received some initial grant funding to take some of the financial risk off my back.
Week 5  Could not grow further and missed growth targets again – started investing time into overhauling sunboxlabs.com and a completely new energy app idea. Finally got LLC paperwork and Azlo account from the Stripe Atlas incorporation, and switching app store ownership, sunboxlabs income and soapdictate income to it – seperating church and state.</description>

      <description>Month 1: Lazer-like focused on writing code and talking to users. After Elisa and I split up from doing giftlab.io, I decided to focus on soapdictate after I&amp;rsquo;d left swissnexSF. soapdictate is my other side-project, and I wanted to see if I could make it work. I left swissnexSF October 31st 2018 and switched to working on the soapdictate dictation app full-time.
Week 1  quickly followed up with all contacts from job to let them know what i&amp;rsquo;m working on incorporated LLC with stripe atlas (more like aside project currently but don&amp;rsquo;t want liability), Did health insurance, worked from friends&amp;rsquo; office.</description>

1 Team Team Team Cofounder Cofounder Cofounder. Team Team Team. I can&amp;rsquo;t stress this enough, and is the main point of learning I&amp;rsquo;ve brought.
2 Problem problem problem Find a hair-on-fire problem (vitamins vs. painkillers). There should be no substitution, and extreme urgency to try your project.</description>
