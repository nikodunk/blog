      <description>Not sure why there&amp;rsquo;s no good resources online on this, but this is one of these silly plumbing issues that can waste hours. The two main libraries to simplify mounting Intercom into React directly are dead, and Intercom&amp;rsquo;s SPA guide is not super helpful.
So without further ado – How to load Intercom to a React component (if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to put it in the head of your index.html) in 2020 is as follows:</description>

      <description>Dear Reader,
Sunboxlabs update – everything else unchanged (though got press for energylollipop but still have no business model and electrade is slowly growing in revenue).
Sunboxlabs: I&amp;rsquo;m a little stuck right now tbh. The early 10 customers love it and are using it for learning about solar, backup, camping.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to re-create the early sales success and am testing different channels:
 Tried building SEO content, Instagram paid Ads, Twitter paid Ads, twitter unpaid.</description>

      <description>Dear Reader,
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I&amp;rsquo;m going to start simply posting my updates as by posting (lightly edited) emails I&amp;rsquo;ve written to founder friends on my progress. This way I save time, can post more often, and I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a more authentic update anyway.
Sorry for no update! Covid hit so we interrupted fundraising and started building and getting deals with local utilities (aka CCAs) while we were waiting, and then Katie got pulled off with her kid (single mother).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re back after a short hold for some contracting (to refresh the coffers). Now with a new project (with a refreshed mind). I have a new team, new project, but same mission – to fight global warming!
Premise: We believe that most people working in energy, solar, and climate change have been making a big mistake — that money, fear, and kilowatt-hours motivate people.
We have a different hypothesis.
Based on deep behavioral research, we discovered that people are more motivated to save energy and install solar when they see data in the form of CO2 — and the message needs to be simple: one number, one color, in real-time.</description>

1 Team Team Team Cofounder Cofounder Cofounder. Team Team Team. I can&amp;rsquo;t stress this enough, and is the main point of learning I&amp;rsquo;ve brought. Cofounders should best-case come before the idea, because the idea will change. This was the case with us – my cofounder left the team when the idea was changing and we weren&amp;rsquo;t finding traction.</description>

      <description>This month has been mostly resetting on a new project, electrade. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interviewing a bunch of EV owners over the phone to ask for problems, and going to a Golden Gate Electric Vehicle Meetup.
Not much to update on this month. Tracking WAU – 20% week over week growth but at this scale it means nothing.

      <description>After 4 months of working on healthcare stuffs and nearly making it (we signed a first deal of $600/mo, but then couldn&amp;rsquo;t deliver an external integration they needed UGH) I have to face the decision to double down again or reset. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to reset to something more in line with my natural interests: I&amp;rsquo;ve now been working for the past couple weeks on the (first) electric vehicle marketplace app. &amp;ldquo;Find a used tesla near me&amp;rdquo; – screenshot attached :)</description>

      <title>How to set up Heroku SSL (HTTPS) with Google Domains in 2019</title>

      <description>Ugh. This wastes time every time I run into it. It&amp;rsquo;s so much easier with AWS, and there&amp;rsquo;s terrible and conflicting documentation out on the web about Heroku, Google Domains and Heroku&amp;rsquo;s ACM for SSL. IF you do everything right, it&amp;rsquo;s actually very simple. So I&amp;rsquo;ll document how it worked for me in 2019 here as much for me as for anyone else.
This article is a &amp;ldquo;fork&amp;rdquo; of David Gagne&amp;rsquo;s great article here, from which I got these steps and tweaked them slightly to update them.</description>

      <description>Month 2: Still laser-focused on writing code and talking to users, but now have found a good potential co-founder, brainstormed a new, bigger problem with him (important!) and received some initial grant funding to take some of the financial risk off my back.
Week 5  Could not grow further and missed growth targets again – started investing time into overhauling sunboxlabs.com and a completely new energy app idea. Finally got LLC paperwork and Azlo account from the Stripe Atlas incorporation, and switching app store ownership, sunboxlabs income and soapdictate income to it – seperating church and state.</description>

      <description>Month 1: Lazer-like focused on writing code and talking to users. After Elisa and I split up from doing giftlab.io, I decided to focus on soapdictate after I&amp;rsquo;d left swissnexSF. soapdictate is my other side-project, and I wanted to see if I could make it work. I left swissnexSF October 31st 2018 and switched to working on the soapdictate dictation app full-time.
Week 1  quickly followed up with all contacts from job to let them know what i&amp;rsquo;m working on incorporated LLC with stripe atlas (more like aside project currently but don&amp;rsquo;t want liability), Did health insurance, worked from friends&amp;rsquo; office.</description>

      <description>Originally posted as &amp;ldquo;8 learnings for startups (from swissnex SF Startup Camp)&amp;rdquo; at startupticker.ch and the swissnex blog.
 This piece was written and posted at my time at swissnex SF. With support from incredible swissnex SF and global teams, we scaled the program from 8-10 companies per year with 2 partners to 16-24 startups per year with 5 partners. We achieved this by shifting our model from 1:1 consultancy to bi-annual camp cohorts with demo days, and through improvements to startup marketing channels, internal processes, and new connections in the ecosystem.</description>
