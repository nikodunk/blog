      <description>This month has been mostly resetting on a new project, electrade. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interviewing a bunch of EV owners over the phone to ask for problems, and going to a Golden Gate Electric Vehicle Meetup.
Not much to update on this month. Tracking WAU – 20% week over week growth but at this scale it means nothing.

      <description>After 4 months of working on healthcare stuffs and nearly making it (we signed a first deal of $600/mo, but then couldn&amp;rsquo;t deliver an external integration they needed UGH) I have to face the decision to double down again or reset. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to reset to something more in line with my natural interests: I&amp;rsquo;ve now been working for the past couple weeks on the (first) electric vehicle marketplace app.</description>

      <description>Month 2: Still laser-focused on writing code and talking to users, but now have found a good potential co-founder, brainstormed a new, bigger problem with him (important!) and received some initial grant funding to take some of the financial risk off my back.
Week 5  Could not grow further and missed growth targets again – started investing time into overhauling sunboxlabs.com and a completely new energy app idea. Finally got LLC paperwork and Azlo account from the Stripe Atlas incorporation, and switching app store ownership, sunboxlabs income and soapdictate income to it – seperating church and state.</description>

      <description>Month 1: Lazer-like focused on writing code and talking to users. After Elisa and I split up from doing giftlab.io, I decided to focus on soapdictate after I&amp;rsquo;d left swissnexSF. soapdictate is my other side-project, and I wanted to see if I could make it work. I left swissnexSF October 31st 2018 and switched to working on the soapdictate dictation app full-time.
Week 1  quickly followed up with all contacts from job to let them know what i&amp;rsquo;m working on incorporated LLC with stripe atlas (more like aside project currently but don&amp;rsquo;t want liability), Did health insurance, worked from friends&amp;rsquo; office.</description>
