      <description>The Atmos stack is optimized around two things: using as few dependencies as possible, and hyper-optimizing around sharing code between different parts of the stack.
We have launched and run a fintech with 10,000+ customers with only 1-2 full-time-equivalent engineers, all while staying secure and fast. With so few engineers to do so much work, we need to be brutally efficient:
More wood behind fewer arrows We unified our stack around Javascript over all clients and API for maximum code efficiency - we do not have time to duplicate features over Kotlin, Swift, Svelte and Python for various parts of the stack and clients.</description>

      <title>Political learnings from open-source</title>

      <description>I think there are parallels between political parties in the US and open-source linux distributions in their attitudes and approaches, and their various effectiveness and popularity.
The different open-source Linux distributions take different attitudes to their packaging:
Arch (cutting-edge, rolling release distribution):
 Sometimes too far forward-looking and unstable. Running sometimes breaking experiments on live systems. Dismantling existing structures before users are ready.  Debian (stable distribution):
 Users wanting to live in the past and getting frustrated at progress.</description>

      <title>From Node to Ruby on Rails</title>
      <link>https://nikodunk.com/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/</link>

      <description>I learned to code in the Javascript stack [1] and am building a Javascript based product [2]. I never questioned this stack: many companies default to it, JS everywhere seems good, and the community is big. But for my new side project I decided to try Rails because despite some perception that Ruby on Rails is ‘over’, people in HN comments say it was somehow more enjoyable than the newer Node based stack.</description>

      <description>Google will be replaced at an ever increasing rate, probably by DuckDuckGo. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to them full-time for the 3rd or 4th time, but this time feel no need to go back. DuckDuckGo has all the developer mindshare, and their growth is exponential. Already I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people do images search on Instagram instead of Google Images, and young people search Snapchat for recipes instead of Google. (Note from 2022: TikTok seems to be doing this) Manufacturing, and having it close by, will become increasingly important again.</description>

      <title>As cities grow, nations will fade.</title>

      <description>Originally posted at swissnex San Francisco as Back to the city
 Democracy was designed for the city 54% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population now lives in cities, and more humans move to urban areas every day. But with voters and power concentrated in metropolitan areas, are nations holding cities back?
Democracy was designed to rule a city, after all – Athens. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ve stretched the democratic system further than it was meant to be expanded?</description>

      <description>A silent 10-day crash course in Buddha’s own technique. Introduction Global Vipassana Pagoda, Mumbai by Flickr user Abhishek Thakur
On my last day in Mumbai, India, I randomly visited the Global Pagoda, a gigantic structure (the largest of its kind) still under construction, rising like a giant spaceship over the wetlands north of the city. Expecting ostentation, I found a surprisingly secular take on a promise otherwise reserved only for religion, paraphrased: We want to end suffering by teaching everyone a technique to avoid the ups and downs of every day life.</description>

      <description>Sometimes saying &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; is the most positive thing to do. When do we say no? Saying no is an incredibly useful tool to weed out random or subpar options, to actively strive towards an absolute goal instead of being reactive to the noise around us. Naturally, a process of negating what you don’t want can only begin once you know what you want. Counterintuitively, the only way to find out what you want is often by saying yes to everything and gathering experience.</description>

      <title>On putting in the hours</title>

      <description>Contrary to our cultural belief in natural talents, popular science is catching on to the idea that the path to success may be linear. And it may require no more than hard work.
The claim (most popularized by Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s Outliers) is that there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a natural talent - talents are achieved through hard work, and it is never too late for anyone to start down that path.</description>

      <description>A simple solution to high rents and long commutes in cities was invented a century ago: building up. But San Francisco is restricted vertically to an extreme degree. Why? It’s not seismic issues, it’s a density limit called Prop M. Why do we limit our cities vertically in this way?
The need for horizontal restraint is obvious: Society needs to define streetscapes, block sizes and green areas to decompress in. Building codes were established to bring some discipline into the city.</description>
