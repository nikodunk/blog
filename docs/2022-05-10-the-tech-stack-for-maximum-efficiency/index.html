<p>The <a href="https://www.joinatmos.com">Atmos</a> stack is not special, but it&rsquo;s different in its approach from most startups of our size: not around newest technology, not around most pure implementation, but around using as few dependencies as possible, sharing code between parts of the stack, and engineering efficiency. This leads to faster, more bug-free feature delivery and time spent actually polishing user experiences.</p>
<p>We unified our stack around JS for maximum deployment efficiency and launched a bank w/ 10,000+ customers with only 1.5 FTE engineers and outlasted competitors, while staying secure and fast. Our goal was always that one single developer could maintain and improve api, web, android, ios, loans. A single developer is with 10-20x less resources than similar competitors threw at the effort. Best case we&rsquo;d have more, but worst case we wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>With so few engineers to do so much work, we needed to be brutally efficient. In a perfect world we&rsquo;d have a single codebase that renders everything server-side and a <a href="/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/">majestic monolith</a> and use a <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318">one-person framework</a>, but due to modern requirements of native apps on 2 platforms, native web experience for specific use cases, and of course still a bunch of protected logic on the backend, plus then a whole 2nd product to lend out the deposits that we&rsquo;re collecting - we needed to balance efficiency and DRYness with reality.</p>
<p>Our stack has allowed us to ship a large amount of features (savings, checking, loans, donations clients on web, ios, android) rapidly, with a minimum of bugs and a maximum of testing.</p>
<h2 id="the-stack">The stack</h2>
<p>Javascript frontends - React &amp; React-Native:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients monorepo (need to tweak Metro config to allow Expo to access /common folder in web. CRA, which web was created in, wont allow any imports from outside /src folder, and wanted to stay on mainline CRA)</li>
<li>Separate &amp; native-feeling, React &amp; React-Native views, navigators &amp; view logic. For a while I wanted to unify these too and deploy mobile with react-native-web, but I&rsquo;m glad I couldn&rsquo;t get this through - didn&rsquo;t feel native enough. Tailwind was sufficient if really needed to port features &amp; views from mobile =&gt; web.</li>
<li>Common shared components in redux (api/state logic), tailwind, utility functions, permission config, etc.</li>
<li>Integration test coverage, enforced by CI on every merge to develop.</li>
<li>When launching mobile, we quickly merged it into our web codebase/repo to benefit from shared logic, and improvements to mobile improving web.</li>
<li>When adding our second product (loans), we merged this into the main web repo almost immediately to piggyback off the devOps of the main product (bank), and also so that the bank could benefit from the component improvements made while engineering a brand new product. Massive design and performance improvements resulted from this, including the removal of Material-UI which we&rsquo;d originally launched on and going with Tailwind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Javascript API - Node (Hapi &amp; Bull Queue) running on Heroku:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggressively updated packages &amp; stacks to newest versions to unlock newest features &amp; ensure security, enabled by next point.</li>
<li>Integration test coverage of critical path user flows (apply, login, transact), enforced by CI on every merge to develop or package update.</li>
<li>When adding our second product (loans), we merged this into the main web repo almost immediately to piggyback off the devOps of the main product (bank), and also so we could benefit from improvements made for loans: Bank received non-blocking account opening and tons of dead code removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webflow for landing pages</li>
<li>Retool to access to numberous admin api functions to detect fraud, approve users, approve loans, see growth, etc. There&rsquo;s a goal to hand-perform a task that needs to be done once, if it happens a second time we write an api job for it, and if it happens a 3rd time we write an interface for that api job, so that engineering never needs to be pulled into (read: block) the loop again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-a-unified-stack">Benefits of a unified stack</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy paste code from the web, mobile, server</li>
<li>Use the same libraries on the web, mobile, server</li>
<li>Use similar testing syntax</li>
<li>Less onboarding for engineers</li>
<li>Library updates on one benefit the other (ie. Node), downside: lib updates block the other</li>
<li>More dogfooding: Dogfooding mobile dogfoods web too - if one team member dogfoods web and another team member dogfoods mobile, we&rsquo;ll have pretty good coverage - especially since most of the code is shared.</li>
<li>Partially related to the above - we <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">chose boring technology</a>, and benefitted from all the upsides metnioned in the talk: devops improvements to one part of our company benefited another, unifying around React lead to us improving already-built products while building out new products, etc etc.</li>
<li>Way fewer dependencies to understand, audit, and use. Downside: we have quite a few eggs in Bull&rsquo;s basket.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-alternatives">The alternatives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flutter, Flutter on web, Rails - still requires 2 languages each with their idiosyncracies, and Flutter on web is half-baked at best. Plus, at this point post-Angular I don&rsquo;t trust Google&rsquo;s commitment to any project long-term</li>
<li>Django, Rails or Express for api &amp; web, Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android - brings 3 languages into the mix for 3x the amount of code writing and debugging, in return for minimal performance benefits and a slightly more native feel.</li>
<li>Electron for web, native &amp; mobile, node for the backend - definitely an option, though feels significantly less native IMO than react-native on mobile, which is 50+ percent of our user base&rsquo;s preferred platform (based on analytics).</li>
<li>Basecamp-style: rendering api &amp; web on Rails, with the mobile app&rsquo;s navigation rendered natively, but the actual screens rendered on the server - this seems crazy, but seems to be working for Hey.com. If another bigger company jumps to this, we could get on board with this. But we don&rsquo;t have time to risk a new approach like this at our scale :)</li>
<li>Microservices, Kubernetes, Terraform, &hellip; overkill for our current scale.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, our all-JS stack may not be the sexiest or most pure, but it is by far the most efficient in the current requirements, and allows us to deliver way more value per engineering hour to customers than other solutions currently available.</p>
