<p>An archived version of the final website (started as Paper Furniture, ended up being called Smoke Furniture Co.) before we switched it off is <a href="http://nikodunk.github.io/smoke/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="1-team-team-team">1 Team Team Team</h1>

<p>Cofounder Cofounder Cofounder. Team Team Team. I can&rsquo;t stress this enough, and is the main point of learning I&rsquo;ve brought.</p>

<h1 id="2-problem-problem-problem">2 Problem problem problem</h1>

<p>Find a hair-on-fire problem (vitamins vs. painkillers). There should be no substitution, and extreme urgency to try your project.</p>

<p><img src="/paper/smoke.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="3-hardware-is-hard">3 Hardware is hard.</h1>

<p>Let me rephrase that: for your <em>first</em> startup, hardware is hard. Hardware is capital and liabilty intensive. For your first startup, maybe look at software: you can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the big boys if you know how to write code. Most new billionaires <em>began</em> with software companies, even if they ended up advancing into hardware. There&rsquo;s a reason that so many founders these days (especially young ones) started with a software project – there&rsquo;s no overhead and you can pivot infinite times without the sunk-cost-fallacy that hardware and minimums bring.</p>

<h1 id="4-give-yourself-enough-time">4 Give yourself enough time.</h1>

<p>The chances that you&rsquo;ll find something that takes off withing 6 months is small. Even if you do find something great, traction takes time. Word of mouth and actual revenue takes time. Make sure you have runway for multiple pivots. We had time for 2 pivots in retrospect (from cardboard to CNC milled furniture to high-end furniture), and found out that the second product was the one that sold best. We&rsquo;d have needed more time to react to this.</p>

<h1 id="5-don-t-incorporate-until-serious-money-is-flowing">5 Don&rsquo;t incorporate until serious money is flowing.</h1>

<p>Get initial, free traction. Do free tests. Ship now. Resist the urge to get feedback from paid marketing, resist the urge to incorporate/sort out naming/ etc – this will all change and only increases overhead. Be lazer-focused on one thing: is there a problem customers will pay for, and can you make money off it (in our case there was something customers would pay for, but we couldn&rsquo;t make money from it as the up-front investment was too much to bear). This comes off the last point – is there a business case? Do your unit economics work? Do an initial test.</p>

<p><img src="/paper/smoke.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="6-plan-ahead-so-you-re-not-forced-to-raise-money">6 Plan ahead so you&rsquo;re not forced to raise money</h1>

<p>We did raise money in the end, but were not in a strong position: we were about to run out of money, and had sunk all of our money into hardware. We should have planned ahead. Hardware is hard for a reason: you need to sink capital in.</p>

<h1 id="7-take-advice-from-the-right-people">7 Take advice from the right people.</h1>

<p>Be careful who you take advice from – we had bad advisors telling us to make 3-year financial projections. We had funders giving us advice on marketing. All of this is irrelevant – and massively distracticing. Do one thing and do it well.</p>

<p><img src="/paper/smokesite.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I still think the lightweight/sustainable furniture space is interesting. We needed more interations on this concept however, and we didn&rsquo;t have the time/runway to do so. This was our fault. We should have planned better, to provide more time for iteration. We should also have built less until we knew more. And I should have picked cofounders more carefully.</p>

<p>Those are the main learnings I&rsquo;ve taken away so far from my first company. In all – not bad for a first experience in startups.</p>
