Similarities between how decisions are made in open source community and how decisions are made in US democracy, specifically leftist, conservative, centrist political parties

Taking teams and point-making out of it onto more neutral software ground maybe teach us something. Popularity contest winner maybe teaches us about where democracy should go.

Caveats:

- Users = Voters? Sort of, but of course in democracy born into it, while in open-source a self-selected 1%. Does the system "work" for all or most users?
- Who gets left behind? The unprivileged in democracy, users with quiet voices or old hardware in Linux.
- While in US the progressives seems to be more worried about who gets left behind, in open-source it's center-right (fedora & debian) - the more conservative movements. That's why it is more conservative.

I think there are parallels between political parties in the US and open-source linux distributions in their attitudes and approaches, and their various effectiveness and popularity.

The different open-source Linux distributions take different attitudes to their packaging:

Arch (cutting-edge, rolling release distribution):

- Sometimes too far forward-looking and unstable.
- Running sometimes breaking experiments on live systems.
- Dismantling existing structures before users are ready.

Debian (stable distribution):

- Users wanting to do things in traditional ways are getting frustrated at progress.
- Fear of breaking anything - to the point of paralysis.
- Not trusting project leadership to progress while listening to users' needs.

Fedora (leading-edge (but not cutting-edge) distribution):

- A balance of the above two methods yielding a sensible, common-sense in-between.
- Democracy at its best: Vote on new measures, which get adopted and rejected with roughly equal frequency.
- Communities thrive when right compromise of progress and stability.

I think the above three projects map to the approaches and problems of progressive, conservative, and centrist US political parties respectively.

Note: Ubuntu used to be in the centrist/common sense position of Fedora and pushed the community forward for a decade, but then chased shiny objects due to a missing business model.

These similarities may be superficial, but I thought it was a neat mapping. Maybe the fact that the most popular distributions are often the centrist ones can give us some hope for the US political system's future.
