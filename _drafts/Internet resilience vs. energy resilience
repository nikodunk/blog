Internet resilience vs. energy resilience


At Pila, our mission is to bring 21st-century energy resilience to households and replace the gas generator. Distributing batteries throughout buildings is the first step, but as the grid breaks into a billion of these intelligent, independent systems, Pila’s goal is also to help define the systems and protocols to ensure they all work together. That means enabling batteries in homes, businesses, and communities to automatically work together as one seamless whole. Through auto-meshing and built-in local intelligence, we can turn individual appliances into a resilient, distributed energy network.

The U.S. electric grid, as it stands today, runs largely on old-school communication networks \- and in some ways, that’s a blessing in disguise. While intelligence and connectivity can unlock enormous potential, it also comes with trade-offs. Too often, it becomes brittle. It ages quickly. And it can introduce new forms of risk, from software vulnerabilities and dependency on internet access, to exposure to unstable supply chains. We’ve already seen how this can go wrong \- consider the [Enel X / JuiceBox EV charger backend deprecation issues](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/enel-x-way-abandoned-its-us-ev-charging-customers-what-happens-next) that left users suddenly unsupported.

In the world of energy, those kinds of failures aren’t just inconvenient \- they’re dangerous. When a smart speaker tfails, [the music stops](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/). But when a smart grid component fails, people lose power. Resilience isn’t optional. And yet, too much of today’s “smart” infrastructure depends on [unnecessary cloud servers](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-wont-connect-my-dishwasher-your-stupid-cloud), [mobile apps](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nightmare-zipcar-outage-is-a-warning-against-complete-app-dependency/), [vendor APIs](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/startup-will-brick-800-emotional-support-robot-for-kids-without-refunds/), or [firmware updates](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-ending-support-for-older-nest-thermostats-will-stop-selling-nests-in-europe/) to [function](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/firmware-hacks-are-rejuvenating-spotifys-car-thing-before-the-company-bricks-it/) [properly](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/leap-year-glitch-broke-self-pay-pumps-across-new-zealand-for-over-10-hours/). That’s not good enough.

***We believe the intelligence layer should be just as resilient as the physical grid itself.*** It can’t be the weakest link. At Pila, we’re building infrastructure-grade, local-first intelligence that runs at the edge independently of the internet, continues working when cloud services go down, and doesn’t rely on remote updates to stay useful. On-device processing and local networking \- paired with optional local APIs and Home Assistant integration \- ensure your microgrid keeps running at full functionality, no matter what happens. The energy system must remain [anti-fragile](https://pilledtexts.com/why-i-use-a-17-year-old-thinkpad/). Some examples of consumer products doing this well right now are [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [Trmnl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=eIcZZX10pa4), [Shelly](https://us.shelly.com/), and the [Powerwall](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/connecting-to-tesla-solar-inverter) and the [original Nest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhqD-ljcD6I) (before Google made Home app obligatory). All of the above examples work fine without the internet and “official apps” from the app store. 

Of course there’s a tremendous amount of value added with an internet connection \- from real-time power price signals to weather data to convenient remote control from your smartphone \- but we believe this value should exist as optional atop the core functionality, not a mission-critical failure point. If AI becomes embedded into everything it too should work local-first and not require a cloud. We believe it belongs on the edge \- close to the energy assets themselves, designed to operate and coordinate autonomously, and built to outlast the hardware it runs on.
