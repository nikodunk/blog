Just as giving your plant slightly less water than you think it needs leads to healthier plants
Giving your body slightly less food than society says it should get has lead me to great health benefits too.

Most of our modern diet (3 meals a day, a bunch of meat) was designed for industrial workers doing manual labor in factories or farms. This does not apply to me. In nature I would have been hungry at least some of the time. More people die from heart attacks from fat buildup than smoking.

A rule I try to live by is: I only eat when I'm hungry. It's surprising how often we're forced to eat (it's lunch time!) when we're not hungry.

Caveats: I'm not talking about people with eating disorders here, and only applies to developed-world, wealthy persons, probably only men, of similar build to me. Aka nerds with computer jobs trying to stay healthy.
