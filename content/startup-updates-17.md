# KPIs/Core Metrics:

- 721 followers of original [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/energylollipop) now.
- [185 users of original California Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/energy-lollipop/jolcdgpgpdlpjafhepiicopakoiifdfm) / Firefox Add-on now.
- $0 revenue, but 1x $70K energy innovation contract, 2x $5K energy efficiency contracts in pipeline (B2B)
- DM'd 900 users on Twitter, 200 on LinkedIn. 250 conversations, 30 hand-picked to join initial alpha of PG&E lollipop (below).

# Product:

- Due to lockdown, bit the bullet and built "personalized" home-energy Chrome extension / app with the PG&E ShareMyData API.

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:

- Tweet/Linkedin DM user acquisition: If tried energy lollipop california, then respond send them energylollipop.com signup page above.
- Set up landing page: try personal energy lollipop beta. Tried to get 100 sign-ups through this [landing page](https://helloworlde.com/energylollipop-home-office). This soft of worked - we got 60, and then hand-picked 30 of them.
- Set up pretend-o-type [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/energylollipop) page and tried to pre-sell. This failed. Consumer pre-monetization would have been too good to be true :)
- Built prototype and 28 users to authorize through PG&E.
- Showed and did 1-hour zoom interview with 12 users, with 12 more scheduled. Our goal is to measure how much they reduce their home's energy consumption in 2 weeks.
- If they do reduce it significantly in 2 weeks, then we can shop it around businesses/governments, Energy companies (aka CCAs or community choice aggregators) and see if they want to use our solution for their users to lower their energy costs (this has already started).

# Help Wanted/Asks:

- Introductions to businesses interested in climate/team programs
- Introduction to angels interested in supporting climate solutions. This team's looking to focus on above concept for a few months.

# Next month

- 12 more user onboarding interviews.
- Measure How would you feel if you could no longer use Energy Lollipop?
  - A) Very disappointed
  - B) Somewhat disappointed
  - C) Not disappointed
  - and get it over 40%.
- Interviewing / giving some people a trial who work in government or lead businesses. If they like using it at home, then we'll see if they're interested in using it at work.
- Meetings set up with 3 businesses/governments so far, but 0 energy companies yet. Selling a community-facing solution to help them lower their energy costs.
