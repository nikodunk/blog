# Team:Â 
* [Katie Patrick](https://twitter.com/katiepatrick), an environmental designer and influencer.
* Myself

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Marketing Spend: $0 (Katie's 19,000 Twitter followers helped).
* 100 users of Chrome extension / Firefox Add-on in last week
* 55% retention after 1w
* 235 followers of Twitter bot
* WoW growth of users: N/A yet
* Revenue: $1,200 (from electrade.app still, but that's another story)

# Product:
![](/startup-updates-16/energy-lollipop-extension.png)

* [Launched Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/energy-lollipop/jolcdgpgpdlpjafhepiicopakoiifdfm?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/energy-lollipop/) add-on and iterated multiple versions to add animations, reward effects, etc.
* Built & launched [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/energylollipop) that tweets out California's emissions graph regularly, and eventually built in more personality, wit and irregularity to the tweeting algorithm.
* Due to retention of the intial tests above being good, we're investing in a "personalized" and premium home-energy Chrome extension / app with the PG&E ShareMyData API. Pre-order [here](https://energylollipop.netlify.com).
* [Electrade.app](https://www.electrade.app) is on the back-burner, but I was lucky to find a talented writer making new content and posting it to the platform, to further build out SEO.

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* set up landing page pretend-o-type: try personal energy lollipop beta. tried to get 100 sign-ups through:
* tweet/linkedin users: try energy lollipop california, then if respond send them website above.
* do brochure pretend-o-type sales: katie's going to corporations.

# Help Wanted/Asks:
* Introductions to businesses interested in climate/team programs
* Introduction to angels interested in supporting climate solutions. This team's looking to focus on this concept for a few months.


# Next month
* Measure How would you feel if you could no longer use Energy Lollipop?
  * A) Very disappointed
  * B) Somewhat disappointed
  * C) Not disappointed
  * and get it over 40%.
