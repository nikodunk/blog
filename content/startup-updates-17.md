![](/startup-updates-17/energy-lollipop-personal.gif)
* Due to lockdown, bit the bullet and built "personalized" home-energy Chrome extension / app with the PG&E ShareMyData API.


# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* Tweet/linkedin users: try energy lollipop california, then if respond send them website above. Talked to 200 users, messaged 750. Mainly funneled them into the below point.
* Set up landing page: try personal energy lollipop beta. Tried to get 100 sign-ups through this [landing page](https://helloworlde.com/energylollipop-home-office). This soft of worked - we got 50+.
* Set up pretend-o-type [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/energylollipop) page and tried to pre-sell. This failed. 
* Built prototype and got 28 users to authorize through PG&E.
* Showed and did 1-hour zoom interview with 12 users, with 12 more scheduled. Measuring how much they reduce for 2 weeks. If they do reduce, then we can shop it around businesses/governments and do pilots there.

# Help Wanted/Asks:
* Introductions to businesses interested in climate/team programs
* Introduction to angels interested in supporting climate solutions. This team's looking to focus on above concept for a few months.

# Next month
* 12 more user onboarding interviews.
* Measure How would you feel if you could no longer use Energy Lollipop?
  * A) Very disappointed
  * B) Somewhat disappointed
  * C) Not disappointed
  * and get it over 40%.
* Also interviewing / giving some people a trial from government and businesses. See if they're interested in using it at work.
