## ![](/projects/logo_sustainability1.gif) sunboxlabs.com v2 | Self-Install Solar Kits for backup generation, etc



<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/demo_sunboxlabs.jpg">

Tested on hacker news, and sold $4.5K of goods in a few days. Then sold an addional $1.5K over the next few weeks on Instagram ads to prove that is is a scalable business. Then pivoted to dropshipping, as I wasn't adding too much value by sending it/rebranding it myself.

<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/demo_paperworklabs.gif">



See ongoing progress in the newer posts on this site, like [this one](/startup-updates-1)

Together with my cofounder, we came up with the idea for Paperwork Labs when he was describing the challenges physicians are facing with government paperwork like the 18-page CPSP forms of California. I built a simple "turbotax for medical forms" in Node in early December, created the below video, and had on initial clients by end of January. Price point: $99/mo/login for all-you-can-eat, constantly updated "smart forms" that can export flat PDFs, report on your "structured data", and potentially integrates with EHRs if they let us. See demo on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZHnqU43t0s)

♜ Challenge: Healthcare Form Automation. Bringing great UX and automation to the user-hostile world of medical forms.

⚑ Solution: An elegantly simple medical form automation tool served from a lightning-fast Node/Express backend, deployed to a HIPAA compliant AWS environment.

Above the original pitchdeck.

The initial idea was to send furniture that’s made of paper through the mail to consumers. Paper Inc. was a furniture company to help mobile urbanites get a room full of furniture with the push of a button.

<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/paper.gif">

We later mailed you a folded “room in a box” that was easy to set up and could simply be recycled or sent back when you move.

This project was born out of the frustration with the extremely expensive 5-axis process of milling the Lunch dining chair. It went to the other extreme. If wood is too expensive, and consumers like me balk at buying expensive furniture when we move every year in our twenties – could I make something more affordable that can simply be recycled the next time I move? I started with the business plan first. The business plan was simple: Connect all the beautiful cardboard furniture designs out there on the internet with manufacturers in Switzerland, and send them directly to the customer. I was specifically trying NOT to design a product, but to design a service this time round. The business plan won a cash prize at the Innovate4Climate 2014 investment, and pushed me and my co-founder, Benjamin Blum, into one of Zurich’s best clean-tech incubators. This was a differentiated product with a clear path.

We ended up pivoting to cnc-milled wood before we started out of fear that people wouldn’t want cardboard furniture. Maybe in retrospect thereby torpedo-ing our differentiation. This also pushed us up over the impulse-buy territory we’d previously occupied, and reduced the furniture’s lightweight mail-order nature. We renamed the project Smoke at the same time and offered all-in-one kits. We raised some pre-seed capital from Swiss Venture days 2015, but my co-founder jumped off back into the corporate world at the wrong moment and the investors re-scinded their offer. Looking back we should have stayed with the original, clear concept of paper furniture and run with it.

## ![](/projects/logo_health.png) Soap Dictate App | Medical Note Transcription App


<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/demo_soap.gif">

Soap dictate was built to help my friend Libo at Stanford Internal Medicine save time on note taking (aka medical charting or documentation) with a mobile app to dictate into templates.

Doctors currently spend around 2 hours a day after their shift typing up notes at the ward desktop, or catching up at home. This app enabled them to save at least an hour of this time by quickly dictating their notes into their phone during their shift, and making it very easy to copy-paste their notes into the EMR system once they’re done. The idea was to help physicians save an hour a day for $9.99 a month.

The app was actually downloaded by massage therapists, acupuncturists and psychotherapists, who wanted to export PDFs and emails, for $3.99 per month. Added a bunch of disclaimers – the HIPAA situation of Apple's Speech Recognition API is unclear as it's encrypted, but Apple won't sign a BAA – however usage and slow growth continues. If Apple one day agrees to sign a BAA for Speech Recognition then I could advertise and grow the app.

# Misc Hardware Projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Juicebar – (hardware concept)

Juicebar was a windowsill energy generator meant to ehlp urbanites be energy independent without access to their rooftops.

The pitch was that as an increasing part of the world’s population lives in dense cities, solar rooftops, which are designed primarily for suburbs, become hard to install. Renting an apartment means you mostly don’t have access to the roof. What you do have power over is your own windowsill. This was inspired by Rob Rhineharts blog-post <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/op-ed-how-i-gave-up-alternating-current/" target="_blank">“How I gave up alternating current”</a>. The project turned into solar for apartment-owners so they could charge their devices off a dedicated DC battery, and create their own energy.

<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/juicebar.jpg">
<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/juicebar.png">


Customers objected that the device was too expensive vs. what money they could save. They also objected that the embodied energy was so high, it would take years to pay off and be “greener” than before. Finally, they objected that the IoT features were useless.

The juicebar project originally came about in the dying days of Paper Inc.: I started playing around with added electrical components to differentiate the tables and chairs we’d already bought and hope to liquidate them on Kickstarter (below). Eventually I dropped the tables completely and went on with a pure window-sill design above. I also added an Arduino for good measure so I could track electrical production during the day (and because IoT funding was readily available…). I also got sucked up in the IoT craze (since this was technically an IoT product), and spent a lot of time pitching and filming, instead of improving the product. This was my first project where coding was involved, so I’m thankful for that. Many Alibaba-sourced 12V lithium batteries & panels were thrashed at this stage.

### ⚡️ Superjuice | Kayak for Energy

<img class="lazy" data-src="/projects/demo_superjuice.gif">  


Price comparison for sustainable energy – The initial version of the above projects (and my first software project!) revolved around price comparison for energy. The US had a solution for apartment renters to go solar easily: You can “virtually” buy energy from renewable farms upstate or out in the ocean. The energy you buy is credited to your electric bill every month. Comparing prices is extremely difficult though. The initial project pitch was this. Superjuice was an energy price search engine that helps apartment owners find the best rates. It does this by indexing all power provider prices in the NY area in real-time. My first online project.

So far we haven't been able to find a business case with these Dapps, and as described <a href="https://nikodunk.github.io/blockchain">here</a>, the development of the ecosystem is so fast-paced (read: everything is still unfinished) – most of these projects are already easier to do as when we built them.

### Building a startup accelerator at swissnexSF

<img class="lazy" data-src="/accelerator/moneyshot1.jpg">  


Next to my learnings described [here](/accelerator), and numerous lessons in marketing, project management, team, networks, et al, I'd like to hold on to one quote from a superior that will stick with me for a while:

	The degree to which you can deploy a digital solution is limited by the network in which you can deploy it.

### Employment at Herzog & de Meuron

When working professionally, designed facades and interiors mostly for competition work. This facade was designed by the team I was on at a large architecture firm in Basel, Switzerland. We won that competition.

### Architecture/Engineering at ETH Zurich


Architecture school project, inspired by Tanizaki’s “In Praise of Shadows”. This project reflected the poetic side of architecture – most of the school was engineering.

### UX/UI contracting in SF

I learned a huge amount about dealing with clients, together with my friend Zebulon Reynolds in San Francisco. The game was an iOS Flight Simulator.
