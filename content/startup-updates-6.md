This month has been mostly resetting on a new project, electrade. I've been interviewing a bunch of EV owners over the phone to ask for problems, and going to a Golden Gate Electric Vehicle Meetup.

Tried the concepts:
* Electric Vehicle News app.
	* Results: works, but not super differentiated
* Electric Vehicle Maps
	* Hard to find good data
* Electric Vehicle price data, static.
	* Not super sensible
* Electric vehicle price data, dynamic.
	* Scraped off autotrader.
* Used electric vehicle price data and new.
	* Not much interest.
* Post your own used electric vehicle.
	* Not much interest
* Post your EV to the gallery.
	* Not much interest.
* Used Teslas near you.
	* Not much interest, lots of competition from EV-CPO.com and onlyusedtesla.com
	* Talked to two folks who could scrape the CPO (certified pre-owned tesla) data from tesla's website.
* Hypothesis:
	* People actually want to lease their cars.
	* Test: deal with a tesla lease partner
	* Found ev-vin.blogspot.com

Not much to update on this month. Tracking WAU – 20% week over week growth.
