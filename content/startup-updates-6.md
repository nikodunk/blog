# Help Wanted/Asks:
* Need office space (update: found in Node U)
* Need cofounders (update: trial)

# Hiring: 
* Candidates in hiring funnel for cofounder: 14
* Interviews: 2
* Trial running with cofounder (Armin)

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Monthly Active Users: 270
* Weekly Active Users: 100
* Daily Active Users: 13-40
* Lease requests: 12
* Lease requests per day: 1-2
* Lease conversions: 0
* Lease conversion revenue: $0

# Product:
* Added weekly LEASE deals scraped from ev-vin.blogspot.com data
* Doing background research myself once received requests. As this was not converting once I'd done the research:
* Added up-front deposit. When the requests stopped added more value – electrade can do paperwork digitally for dealer, and act as a proxy between dealer and user ("price security/no stressful negotiations")

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* ### **Problem: Not installing app (acquisition). Attempts to solve:**
	* Free ASO worked on. Ran many experiments but managed to score top 10 with "lease car" and "electric vehicles".
		* **Results:** increased from non-ranked to top 20 in "Electric Vehicles" and "Lease Car". Impressions 7X. Installs flat.
	* Free DM Reddit (manual) /r/electricvehicles and /r/teslamotors
		* **Results:** Wrong kind of customer. EV enthusiast but not car shopper when manually reaching out. Not sticky. $0 per install. 1 in 20 installs.
	* Free Leasehackr.com forum link as acquisition channel super effective.
		* **Results:** 60+ targeted leads to going up in App Store rankings (point 1). Very negotiation-happy customer – wrong kind of customer? Budget customer.
	* Paid Reddit paid on /r/electricvehicles and /r/teslamotors
		*  **Results:** $0.45 per tap Android and $0.49 on iOS. Roughly 50% install rate from product page -> Roughly $1 per install.
	* Paid iOS App store:
		**Results:** $2.50 per tap, not sure if installed.


* ### **Problem: Installed, Not requesting. Attempts to solve:**
	* Single-number lease price (incl. all). 
		* **Results:** Sticker shock is real. Lease requests down to 0 in the week that attempted this. Started up again once reverted to "monthly" + "down"
	* Added "X more left at this price" to increase urgency. 
		* **Results:** No significant increase in tapthrough rate
	* Added "X people looking at this deal" to increase urgency. 
		* **Results:** No significant increase in tapthrough rate
	* Potentially finding wrong customer – people off leasehackr may LIKE negotiating. Find different customers? => Reddit customers work better.


* ### **Problem: User requesting, but not converting on email step. Attempts to solve:**
	* Better conversion email – 48 hour limit to increase urgency.
		* **Results:** No difference. Drop off.
	* Better conversion email – Not give full number over 36 months as looks high.
		* **Results:** No difference. Drop off.
	* Upfront down payment – $200 deposit.
		* **Results:** 1 attempt to pay, may be fraud. Potentially may take 60 days to convert customers, though once have app installed, though.
	* Added value: Do all paperwork digitally & pay deposit to lock in so don't have to haggle with dealer – just pick up & pay.
		* **Results:** Same as above. Not sure this convenience is a pain point. Reached out to ask for feedback from email addresses but no response.


* ### **Tested EV insurance**
	* Loads of complaints online about how it's expensive. Added Metromile affiliate program.
		* **Results:** 0 sign-ups so far after 2 weeks of cohorts.

### Experiments for next 2 weeks:
* Test Concierge service (you say which car, we'll find at a price).
* Test Consultant service (we'll answer your EV questions and then recommend products).
* Change from pure EV? Potentially, the hassle-free value proposition may be more effective in a mainstream market for now?
* Add off-lease cars from Greenlight Auto Wholesale ?
* Help find parking spots with charging for those EV owners without a garage w/ Piedparker.com ?
* Rent an EV for a month between leases?
