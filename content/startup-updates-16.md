We're back after a short hold and re-group for some contracting (to refresh the coffers) and a new project (to refresh the mind). I have a new team, new project, same mission – to fight global warming!

# Team: 
* Teamed up with [Katie Patrick](https://twitter.com/katiepatrick), an environmental designer and influencer.

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Revenue: $1,200 (from electrade still, however)
* Marketing Spend: $0
* 100 users of Chrome extension / Firefox Add-ond
# 235 followers of Twitter bot

# Product:
* [Launched Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/energy-lollipop/jolcdgpgpdlpjafhepiicopakoiifdfm?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/energy-lollipop/) add-on and iterated multiple versions to add animations, reward effects, etc.
* Built & launched [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/energylollipop) that tweets out California's emissions graph regularly, and eventually built in more personality, wit and irregularity to the tweeting algorithm.
* Due to retention of the intial tests above being good, we're investing in a "personalized" and premium home-energy Chrome extension / app with the PG&E ShareMyData API.
* Electrade.app is on the back-burner, but I was lucky to find a talented writer making new content and posting it to the platform, to further build out SEO.

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* People will download a Chrome extension (true)
* People will keep opening it up (after positive feedback, week 1 retention is still around 55% daily)

# Next month
* Launching Home Energy Lollipop (so not california-wide emissions, but your home's emissions!) through PG&E API. This should give the user more agency to actually change the number and create a tighter feedback loop.
* Launching Home Energy Lollipop (so not california-wide emissions, but your office's emissions!) through PG&E API. This should give the users more agency to actually change the number and create a tighter feedback loop. Also, it'll build community within the office for the teams.
* Starting to raise an angel round from people who care about climate change, so Katie and I can focus on this project for a few months. Also applying for YC, etc.
* Presenting to businesses, to see if business case is there (see ask – introductions to businesses interested in sustainability programs much appreciated).


# Help Wanted/Asks:
* Introductions to businesses interested in climate/team programs
* Introduction to angels interested in supporting climate solutions
