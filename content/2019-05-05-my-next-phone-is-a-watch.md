- Apple Watch + Airpods may the future, since cellular reception was added a few years ago.
- I prefer a what I'd like to coin a "heads-up lifestyle" instead of a heads-down one.
- I still only use the 4 killer features of the original iPhone, which are in the Apple watch too: Phone, Messaging, Maps, Music & Podcasts
- Apps I can use on my desktop now thanks to M1 Catalina.
- Typing and web is easier on my desktop.

The only thing that may convince me otherwise, is if I can replace my smarphone with a smartphone that [respects my privacy](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2022/05/30/towards-gnome-shell-on-mobile/)
