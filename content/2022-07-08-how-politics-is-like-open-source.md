I think there are parallels between political parties in the US and open-source linux distributions in their attitudes and approaches, and their various effectiveness and popularity.

The different open-source Linux distributions take different attitudes to their packaging:

Arch (rolling distribution):

- Sometimes too far forward-looking and unstable.
- City experiments.
- Dismantling capitalism.

Debian (stable distribution):

- People wanting the past and getting frustrated at progress.
- Fearful of breakage leads to paralysis.
- Not trusting leadership to progress while listening to their needs.

Fedora (leading-edge distribution):

- The "centrist" approach of balancing the above two methods yields a sensible inbetween.
- Communities thrive when right compromise of progress and stability.
- Ubuntu used to be in this position and pushed the community forward for a decade, but then chased shiny objects due to a missing business model.
- Democracy at its best.

I believe these map to progressive, conservative, and centrist political attitudes in the US.

These similarities may be superficial, but I thought it was a neat mapping. Maybe the fact that the most popular distributions are often the centrist ones can give us some hope for the US political system's future.
