# Help Wanted/Asks:
* N/A

# Hiring:Â 
* Working with Armin now. Calls every other day, text continuously.
* Talked to another potential cofounder. Not as interested in this project.

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Monthly Active Users: 270
* Weekly Active Users: 100
* Daily Active Users: 13-40
* Revenue: $0
* Got out of building: Every single day.

# Product:
* Added polish
* Made up-front reservation fee default. Clearer to test value for now.
* Tested test-drives
* Removed insurance
* Added value-add club
	* Found out NIO is doing the same things
	* Found out Carmiq is doing the same thing.
* Got out of building with off-line marketing.
	* Distributed 100 Flyers & Posters
	* Talking to people at charging stations (5)
	* Spent days in Daly City Supercharger.



# Experiments/Hypothesis run:

* ### Problem: Not one user opened Stripe Credit Card screen to lease car. Possible Solutions:
	* More trustworthy seeming interace help?
		* Clearer onboarding process. More trustworthy
		* Polish, so app seems less sketchy
		* Results: One stripe open, still no checkouts.
		* ![](/startup-updates-7/1_experiment.png)
		* ![](/startup-updates-7/1_results.png)
	* Value-add to differentiate (Fair has "cancel any time" and "bundled insurance")
		* New cofounder Amir suggested we try a value-add add-ons/Benefits on top of lease to differentiate ourselves from normal leasing lke Fair's "Cancel any time"?
		* Results: No difference.
	* And what if could sell unbundled from car lease, too?

* ### Experiment: Sell value-add features separately, without the car leasing, through digital marketing.
	* $35 per month value-add benefits EV bundle (pivot)
	* Add leases again later once we're the AAA of EVs. 
	* Upside: Address _whole_ EV market, not just subset actively looking for EV lease.
	* Upside: Less friction due to 1 month instead of 36 month commitment. $35 commitment instead of $8,000 commitment for lease.
	* Advertise new value prop through paid marketing. If we can get 10 people to pay $35 in the next week we'll pivot.
		* Reddit **Results:** 18 clicks for $8 -> 5 installs ($1.6 per install) -> 5 people touched through to pricing -> 0 subscribers
		* iOS **Results:** 3 installs for $6 -> None of them actual customers, none of them even in the USA.
	* Advertise new value prop through paid marketing, but with better tag line and investing into marketing: "Put your EV needs on autopilot".
		* Reddit: **Results:** 18 clicks for $7.97 -> 5 installs ($1.6 per install) -> 4 people touched through to pricing -> 0 subscribers.  
		* ![](/startup-updates-7/2_experiment.png) ![](/startup-updates-7/2_results.png)
	* **Results:** Paid ads not working, and no need for product.
		* Marketing: What if we try as content marketing with blog piece on new better title?
		* Product: NIO is offering home-charging pickup in China for NIO owners. -> working in China?
		* Marketing: Offline marketing with flyers and and talking to users.

* ### Experiment: Sell value-add features separately through physical marketing.
	* Specifically, one value add service because that's a thing in China with NIO.
	* What if we put flyers on chargers (pre-targeted audience) and let people text my number for a $35 per pickup to validate the market for this same thing in the USA? 
	* 4 tear-off strips next to chargers. **Results:** No callbacks
	* ![](/startup-updates-7/3_experiment.JPG)
	* ![](/startup-updates-7/3_experiment2.JPG)
	* 120 flyers distributed under windscreen wipers. **Results:** No callbacks.
	* ![](/startup-updates-7/4_experiment.png) ![](/startup-updates-7/4_experiment2.png)
	* **Results:** Physical ads working, but no need for this service.
		* Marketing: Pretty sure physical flyer marketing is the way to go â€“Â we're definitely getting infront of the right, targeted customers now (ie. Tesla owners).
		* Product: No need for this service, but we're sure of this now after doing flyers AND talking to customers.

* ### Experiment: Go into field and watch people at supercharger stations.
	* Watch people at superchargers - Like Airbnb live-in that Chesky did. Notes from field: 
		* Supercharging stations feel like a Tesla club on the top story of this parking garage (this is what NIO was trying to achieve?).
		* Tried to see what people are buying when they leave their car (quickly) but a large share of people just sit in their car. Seat back. Kids play. They're on their phone. Read paper. Door open. Downtime.
		* How to get their attention though? QR codes won't work or are too lossy â€“Â they don't look up. Driving sign in front of them for app or sign to order coffee from nearby store? Or float? -> "Supercharged coffee", Supercharger snacks, Supercharger food truck.
		* Supercharger take-out (charges too fast to pick up food said youtube video)
		* Supercharger chat for people who are bored.
		* Supercharger delivery
		* QR code to market the app?
		* Supercharger ads on drive-by car?
		* Supercharger club - remote services at superchargers. We bring you stuff at superchargers. It's like take-out at superchargers. Nearby stuff at superchargers.
		* ![](/startup-updates-7/IMG_1354.JPG)
		* Learning: Get out of the building, go off-line.
		* **Results:** New idea! ðŸ‘‡

* ### Experiment: Sell delivery service at supercharger stations to people sitting in their cars (with sign, walk up to windows in T-Shirt so not sketched out).
	* 20 cars go through per hour on average.
	* 5 cars per hour convert * $8 * 10 hours = $400. Pay someone $150 of that.


# Experiment backlog:
* Test Concierge service (you say which car, we'll find at a price).
* Test Consultant service (we'll answer your EV questions and then recommend products).
* Change from pure EV? Potentially, the hassle-free value proposition may be more effective in a mainstream market for now?
* Add off-lease cars from Greenlight Auto Wholesale ?
* Help find parking spots with charging for those EV owners without a garage w/ Piedparker.com ?
* Rent an EV for a month between leases?
