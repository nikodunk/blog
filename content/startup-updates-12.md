# Help Wanted/Asks:
* N/A

# Hiring:Â 
* Talked to Patrick from Byteryde.com, and shared some experiences on our different takes on the same idea of solving EV / Tesla insurance.

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Revenue: $340
* Marketing Spend: $30.43 on Reddit (working! But limited.)

# Product:
* Did contracting this month, so put in no active marketing or blogging on hold.
* Nevertheless, starting to rank on first page for keywords like "Tesla Insurance Review" et al.
* Tried Reddit ads, and seem to be profitable.

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* N/A

# Next month
* Thinking of hiring a writer to create 3x weekly posts. 
* If that is profitable, could add more categories of EV services (as we already have partnerships with the excellent YCombinator backed [Ampup.io](https://www.ampup.io) platofrm, etc).
* Now that the "shackles" of aiming for VC money have been removed, turning electrade into a resource on the web of EV information is interesting: A Nerdwallet-like platform for EV knowledge, starting with EV insurance.
