Glad to read [this](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/gilets-jaunes-grassroots-heroes-or-kremlin-tools), after a few weeks of wondering how the [Gillets Jaunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement) movement in France could organize through Facebook Groups yet no-one was drawing the parallels to the [last time](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/11/01/russian-facebook-page-organized-protest-texas-different-russian-page-l/) social unfairness was harnessed by a foreign power to turn out mass-protests. Apparently there's no smoke to that fire.
