# Help Wanted/Asks:
* N/A

# Hiring: 
* Working with Armin now. Calls every other day, text continuously.
* Added Suhas Ghante to the mix.

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Revenue: $480

# Product:
* Clearcover integration finally completed
* First revenue



# Experiments/Hypothesis run:

* Spent a month getting the clearcover integration live (3 weeks from call to live but the 4th of July week slowed everything down).
* Re-launched with new content once Clearcover API partnership live.
* Marketing: Content
	* Wrote 3 pieces.
	* All 3 team members wrote a blog piece & I posted to Reddit.
		* Results: 
			* 1000 total reads
			* 15 quotes completed
			* 4 purchase intents ($160 revenue)
			* ? purchases
		* Learnings: 
			* Validated that people will click through the checkout flow. This was our main worry – that the form was now too long.
			* New problem: When followed up over email – without exception, feedback is that it's more expensive than Geico.
			* Still purchase intent given though even if didn't complete purchase: $40 per clickthrough.

	* Quote API experiment: 
		* Pre-set the coverages to _minimum_ coverages -> insurance will seem more affordable by default.
		* Clearcover told us not legal to pre-set coverages so back to original API.
		* 5 purchase intents ($200 revenue)
		* ? purchases (can't track as still handing off to partner)

* Results:
	* Went viral on Google Search through Android search.
	* 15 more quote requests.
