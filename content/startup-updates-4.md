Key Events
----

Bad
----
* We lost the client mentioned in the last monthly update, due to their top-brass insisting on a (technically nearly impossible) integration with their existing EMR provider after the first invoice was already due. The EMR provider wouldn't play ball for this integration. After hearing this same push-back from 4 clients, the fourth of which agreed and signed but somehow hadn't understood that we can't integrate with their EMR until the final moment (we'd told them), I think this is an actual dealbreaker for the healthcare centers.
* We looked into things like Selenium to move their mouse onscreen and enter the info into the EMR without human input, but decided this was too hacky.
* We pivoted the product 3 weeks ago and re-used the same health contacts and pitched them 4 new ideas. The best of which was a new workflow idea, but after 4 calls no actual buying interest. We have 2 more calls next week. The current concept (and the last one) is online still at paperworklabs.com.
* We're very far away from the original goal of the company at this point, so the options are to double-or-nothing again or to pivot.

Good
----
* We're currently leaning towards pivoting, which after 4 months and 3 concepts hurts, but after so much invested effort in health I keep getting drawn back to the exploding electric vehicle market:
* This side project is called Electrade â€“ the world's first electric vehicle marketplace. It's been on the app store for a week, and I'm working on ASO currently and going to EV meetups.


Asks
----
* Bear with us during this hard reset. There comes a time after 4 months where I had to question the direction this project was growing in.
* Intros to EV enthusiasts, and people with automobile market experience.
