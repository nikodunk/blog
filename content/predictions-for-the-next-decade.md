* Google will be replaced as the up-and-coming search engine by DuckDuckGo, as starting today I've switched to them full-time and feel no need to go back. They have more developer mindshare. Possibly also Facebook and Apple who have been running on fumes for a while but I am less sure there. Their core products are not actively being made worse at the rate that Google's is.
* Manufacturing, and having it close-by, will become increasingly important again. So far we've said "let's outsource this", but we're seeing the drag on innovation by not being able to make our own stuff close-by.
* Electric Vehicles, though that's a pretty obvious one.
* Software as we know it is currently important but I believe will become increasingly commoditized and unimportant.
* Cities will take over the political and social lead, in place of states. See also [here](https://nikodunk.com/cities/).
