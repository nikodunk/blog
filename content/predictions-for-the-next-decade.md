* Google will be replaced at an every increasing rate by DuckDuckGo. I've switched to them full-time for the 3rd or 4th time, but _this_ time feel no need to go back. DuckDuckGo has all the developer mindshare, and their growth is [exponential](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic). Possibly also Facebook and Apple who have been running on fumes for a while but I am less sure there. Their core products are not actively being made worse at the rate that Google's is.
* Manufacturing, and having it close-by, will become increasingly important again. So far we've said "let's outsource this", but we're seeing the drag on innovation by not being able to make our own things close-by. [Tesla](https://youtu.be/r46x_ti__vs?t=1717) was incubated in England's Lotus because they still have small-scale workshops /supply chain ecosystem to deal with it. [Phones](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/12/purism-announce-1999-librem-5-usa-same-librem-5-just-made-in-america) being made in Texas, I predict all nations will re-focus on making their own Shenzhen. Probably with mixed results, same as for the last decade everyone tried to copy Silicon Valley.
* Electric Vehicles, though that's a pretty obvious one at this point. 6 months ago when the following article was written though, everyone was calling them crazy. Read it [here](https://nikodunk.com/4-reasons-why-electric-vehicles-will-dominate-sooner-than-you-think/).
* Software as we know it is currently important but I believe will become increasingly commoditized and unimportant. Already no-code AI, web-apps and games are becoming a thing.
* Cities will take over the political and social lead, in place of states. See also [here](https://nikodunk.com/cities/).
