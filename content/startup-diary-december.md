November 2018
===

Week 1
---
* quickly followed up with all contacts from job to let them know what i'm working on
incorporated LLC with stripe atlas (more like aside project currently but don't want liability), Did health insurance, worked from friends' office.
* built subscription, built 60-sec dictation.



Week 2
---
* Spent weekend and Monday with a friend doctor and original user to learn more and think of features.
* In dedicated office – spacious.com
* Asking for intros to physicians.
* First subscriber! Emailed the hell out of her. Ran the friends' feature by her on Friday – creating a billable PDF note. She liked so building it.

Week 3
---
* Really hitting stride. Work from spacious (gets me out of home for $129/mo). Talking to Users and Writing code.
* Asking for intros to physicians.
* Shipped first differentiated version Monday (dictate / create PDF billable note)
* Sales slow though. Grind. Emailing users, writing features for them.
* Enough physician interviews that know not physicians (process of elimination). My one paying customer is acupuncturist – maybe that's it. Talking to dentists and psychotherapists too.


Week 4
---
* New sign-ups stopped. User week necessary.
* Physicially going to acupuncturists and signing them up. 
* Asking for intros to acupuncturists, psychotherapists and dentists.
* Second sign-up! Now 2 paying users.
* Michael (Mentor) recommended I start fundraising with proto + users.

December 2018
===


Week 5
---
* Could not grow further and missed growth targets again.
* Invested time into a new energy app and sunboxlabs.com overhaul.
* ***Pivot 1***
* Brainstormed with a new, smart cofounder, and we had a good groove. Came up with a 100M idea to validate.
* Built a prototype, shipped it. A "hair-on-fire" problem: Turbotax for medical forms.
* Had call with Alain (Mentor). He recommended I talk to investors before I need them. Just get their advice. Send them a and monthly update. He will send me a template. Get Feedback from current customers with customer development survey tool: http://survey.io/survey/demo

Week 6
---
* 3 clients in pipeline, each with 10s of practices that are struggling with forms and are open to $99/month price point.
* Received Grant from Emergent Ventures with possible follow-up. Worth investing in mission of solving healthcare paperwork.
* Building prototype form automation tool.
* Second working session with Mitul:
	* Cold-emailed 100s of clients
	* Made landing page
	* Goal to validate: By January 31st we will have 1st paying client – go/no-go.

Week 7
---
* Investing time in prototype
* Had first sales call with LA practice group. Want to wait for further build-out. Hypothesis: they didn't understand the product. 
* Users generally unresponsive although we _know_ they have this issue —> made 1-min video walkthrough of demo.
* Had call with Michael (mentor): Likes deck and vision to 100M.
* Slow before xmas? Not so much.

Week 8
---
* Xmas, no go.
* Heard back from first potential client due to video follow-up: Same client that said hold off now wants demo call in January! Could be our initial client.
* From now on will post the monthly investor update Alain gave me, and inspired by Can Olcer's [Blog](shafyy.com), I will post shorter, less formal posts.
