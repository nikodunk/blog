## The problem

I live in San Francisco, an our city beach is exactly 4.7 miles away from my apartment in Haight. It's a beautiful bike ride, but so far if I wanted to go surf I'd either have to rely on my friend Jake, who has a car, to also go right now, or take the N-Line on Muni which is unreliable (especially on weekends).

I wanted to use my road bike, and I didn't really want to buy and put a surfboard bike rack on it, and most of them seemed designed for beach cruisers anyway.

## A possible solution

So today I made numerous experiments trying to build my own trailer, lash my surfboard onto my frame, but eventually came up with a way simpler solution: simply lash it to a backpack. I'll leave share it here hoping you can use it for your surf commute. 

Added benefits of going to surf on a bike is a great warm-up, no parking hassle at the beach, and fresh air.
