## The problem

I live in San Francisco, and our city beach is exactly 4.7 miles away from my apartment in Haight (yay!). It's a beautiful bike ride, but it's slightly far than I can carry my board under my arm on my bike (boo), and so far if I wanted to go surf I'd either have to rely on my friend Jake (who has a car) to also go right now, or take the N-Line on Muni which is unreliable (especially on weekends) (boo!).

Why not a bike rack? Well, I have a road bike, which isn't build to hold a board rack. Also, bike racks cost money. Also, I only surf about 2 days a week and don't want to drive around for the rest of the week with a huge surf rack appendix jutting out of it. Finally, we all know a side-mounted surfboard isn't great for your balance and acts like a sail when cycling through Golden Gate Park.

## A possible solution

So today I made numerous experiments trying to build my own bike trailer out of rolling suitcases, lash my surfboard onto my frame, but eventually came up with a way simpler solution: simply lash it to a backpack. I'll leave share it here hoping you can use it for your surf commute. This will only work with shortboards under 6 feet, I'd say – but your mileage may vary. This one's 5'8". A 7' still work.

Added benefits of going to surf on a bike is a great warm-up, no parking hassle at the beach, and fresh air.
