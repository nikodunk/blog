* Added (Progressive Web) App.
* Continued to refine chrome extension
* 12 more user onboarding interviews.


# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* Found new possible revenue avenue: electrification. CCAs earn 3-4cents per kwh net revenue per increased sales. We can push people towards electrification. Rebate for electric elements possibly, etc.


# Help Wanted/Asks:
* Introductions to businesses and CCAs (ie. local utilities) interested in climate programs
* Introduction to angels interested in supporting climate solutions. This team's looking to focus on above concept for a few months.

# Next month
* Sales mode and further product refinements.
