At Pila, our immediate mission is to bring 21st-century energy resilience to every household and retire the gas generator for good. Distributing batteries throughout buildings for modern energy security is the first step, but as the grid breaks into a billion of these intelligent, independent systems, Pila’s far more ambitious goal is also to help define the operating system and protocols to ensure they all work together. That means enabling batteries in homes, businesses, and communities to automatically collaborate as one seamless whole. Through auto-meshing and embedded local intelligence, we can turn individual appliances into the world’s largest  ultra-resilient, distributed energy network.

The U.S. electric grid, as it stands today, runs largely on old-school communication networks \- and in some ways, that’s a blessing in disguise. While intelligence and connectivity can unlock enormous potential, it also comes with trade-offs. Too often, we introduce new brittleness. “Smart” yet inflexible hardware often ages quickly and its capabilities fall behind. And it can introduce new forms of risk, from software vulnerabilities and excessive dependency on internet access, to exposure to unstable supply chains. We’ve already seen how this can go wrong \- just consider the [Enel X / JuiceBox EV charger backend deprecation issues](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/enel-x-way-abandoned-its-us-ev-charging-customers-what-happens-next) that left thousands of users suddenly unsupported.

In the world of energy, those kinds of failures are more than inconvenient \- they’re downright dangerous. When a smart speaker fails, [the music stops](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/). But when a smart grid component fails, people lose power. Resilience isn’t optional. And yet, too much of today’s “smart” infrastructure depends on [unnecessary cloud servers](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-wont-connect-my-dishwasher-your-stupid-cloud), [mobile apps](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nightmare-zipcar-outage-is-a-warning-against-complete-app-dependency/), [vendor APIs](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/startup-will-brick-800-emotional-support-robot-for-kids-without-refunds/), or [firmware updates](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-ending-support-for-older-nest-thermostats-will-stop-selling-nests-in-europe/) to [function](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/firmware-hacks-are-rejuvenating-spotifys-car-thing-before-the-company-bricks-it/) [properly](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/leap-year-glitch-broke-self-pay-pumps-across-new-zealand-for-over-10-hours/). That’s not good enough.

***We believe the intelligence layer should be just as resilient as the physical grid itself.*** It can’t be the weakest link. At Pila, we’re building infrastructure-grade, local-first intelligence that runs at the edge independently of the internet, continues working when cloud services go down, and doesn’t rely on remote updates to stay useful. On-device processing and local networking \- paired with optional local APIs,Home Assistant integration, and more \- ensure your microgrid keeps running at full functionality, no matter what happens. The energy system must remain [anti-fragile](https://pilledtexts.com/why-i-use-a-17-year-old-thinkpad/). Some examples of consumer products I think are doing this well right now are [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [Trmnl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=eIcZZX10pa4), [Shelly](https://us.shelly.com/), and the [Powerwall](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/connecting-to-tesla-solar-inverter) and the [original Nest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhqD-ljcD6I) (before Google made Home app obligatory). All of the above examples work fine without the internet and “official apps” from the app store. 

Of course there’s a tremendous amount of value added with an internet connection \- from real-time power price signals to weather data to convenient remote control from your smartphone \- but we believe this value can exist as optional benefit atop the core functionality, not a mission-critical failure point. If AI becomes embedded into everything, it too should work local-first and not require a cloud. We believe it belongs on the edge \- close to the energy assets themselves, designed to operate and coordinate autonomously, and built to outlast the hardware it runs on.

The future grid won’t rely on fragile, centralized control. It will emerge from billions of resilient, intelligent systems at the edge.
