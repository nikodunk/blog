# Experiments/Hypothesis run:

- Found new possible revenue avenue: electrification. CCAs earn 3-4cents per kwh net revenue per increased sales. We can push people towards electrification. Rebate for electric elements possibly, etc.

# Help Wanted/Asks:

- Introductions to businesses and CCAs (ie. local utilities) interested in climate programs
- Introduction to angels interested in supporting climate solutions. This team's looking to focus on above concept for a few months.

# Next month

- Sales mode and further product refinements.
