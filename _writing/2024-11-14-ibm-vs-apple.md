It's 2024, and an absurd situation has occurred. IBM is the rebel pushing up against the corporate dominance of Apple, Inc.

I use Fedora Linux. Fedora Linux is the open source development arm of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Red Hat is owned by IBM.

Fedora, and image-based Linux derivatives like Bluefin and Bazzite, are the seeds of the open future. Using this system in 2024 is a rebellious statement against the closed Apple ecosystem overlord - the dominant OS suite that today's youth is being brought up on.

Apple has lived long enough to become the villain. International Business Machines, the old guard, has survived (and acquired) long enough to become the "scrappy" upstart arming the rebels.
