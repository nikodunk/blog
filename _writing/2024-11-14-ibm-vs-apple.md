I just realized an absurd situation has occurred. In 2024, the situation is the opposite of the 1983 photo above. IBM is the rebel pushing up against the corporate dominance of Apple, Inc. Bear with me for this slightly constructed story:

I use Fedora Linux on the desktop. Fedora Linux is the open source development arm of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Red Hat is owned by IBM.

Fedora, and image-based Linux derivatives like Bluefin and Bazzite, are the seeds of the open future. Using this system on the desktop in 2024 is a rebellious statement against the closed Apple ecosystem overlord - the dominant OS suite that today's youth is being brought up on [1].

Apple has lived long enough to become the corporate overlord. They are valued at 17x IBM as of Nov 11, 2024. International Business Machines, the old guard, has survived (and acquired) long enough to become the "scrappy" upstart arming the resistance.

[1] Apple is chiefly dominant on mobile phones in the US, I know, but their desktop is dominant in many circles, and is becoming pretty closed vs. the alternatives with things like running unsigned software, etc
