## ![](/assets/projects/logo_health.png) Soap Dictate App | Medical Note Transcription App

Soap dictate was built to help my friend Libo at Stanford Internal Medicine save time on note taking (aka medical charting or documentation) with a mobile app to dictate into templates.

Doctors currently spend around 2 hours a day after their shift typing up notes at the ward desktop, or catching up at home. This app enabled them to save at least an hour of this time by quickly dictating their notes into their phone during their shift, and making it very easy to copy-paste their notes into the EMR system once they’re done. The idea was to help physicians save an hour a day for $9.99 a month.

Together with Libo Wang and initially Steven Pease, we set out to help with the burn-out rate of doctors at Stanford Internal Medicine: This app helps doctors (who have irregular schedules and little free time) work out who’s off and up to hang out with a super simple calendaring app.
