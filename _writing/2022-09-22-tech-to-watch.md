Adapted from a recent response to an Indiehackers topic [Mission vs Money: What do you prioritize?](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/mission-vs-money-what-do-you-prioritize-8fcbb0daab)

I think you need both. I try to find the balance this way:

1. There's a lot of potential business ideas.
2. A subset of them will have some output/side-effect that is on-mission for you.
3. Try out all those ideas. A subset of them will work.

For example my mission is climate. Very easy to not be able to live off your climate efforts though: nonprofits, thanksless work, civic engagement, etc.

So now

1. of all business ideas I think of
2. I only consider doing the subset that could have a climate impact.
3. I try most of those in the subset. A subset of them hopefully will work :)
