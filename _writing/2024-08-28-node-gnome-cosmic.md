In general, it seems like a bad idea to "start over from a clean slate" in Open Source software. More wood behind fewer arrows seems like the way to go to avoid fragmentation, bike shedding and re-inventing wheels. But of the best things to happen to Node in the past few years was Bun and Deno. Node's pace of improvement has [increased dramatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oU_TTbG-O8) once it got some real competition to be inspired by (.env support, test runner, watch mode, glob support, top-level await, require/ESM cross-import, single file bundle, Typescript support out of box, SqlLite, window shim, and stable fetch).

While I like the Gnome desktop project, they do sometimes feel a little slow in their rate of innovation & their openness to innovation. Merge requests that everyone's pretty much on board with can be open for years. Maybe Cosmic desktop's “fork” (technically re-build) and a little competition will speed them up like Node was sped up by Bun and Deno!
