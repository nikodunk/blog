This month has been mostly resetting on a new project, electrade. I've been interviewing a bunch of EV owners over the phone to ask for problems, and going to a Golden Gate Electric Vehicle Meetup.

Not much to update on this month. Tracking WAU – 20% week over week growth but at this scale it means nothing.

# Help Wanted/Asks:

- N/A

# Hiring: 

- N/A

# KPIs/Core Metrics:

- Monthly Active Users: 50
- Weekly Active Users: 20
- Daily Active Users: 5-10
- Posts: 0

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:

- Electric Vehicle News app.
  - Results: works, but not super differentiated
  - Some retention as an EV news reader app.
- Electric Vehicle Maps
  - Hard to find good data
  - Talked to Plugshare for their API data, but expensive.
- Electric Vehicle price comparison, New
  - Static Data – Scraped off an EV information website. They never update their prices.
    - Not super sensible.
  - Dynamic Data – scraped off autotrader.
    - <10 taps, no retention.
  - Not differentiated from Autotrader.
- Electric Vehicle price comparison, Used & New.
  - <10 taps, no retention.
- Post your own used electric vehicle.
  - 0 taps
- Post your EV to the gallery.
  - 8 taps
  - 0 posts
- Used Teslas near you.
  - Not much interest, lots of competition from EV-CPO.com and onlyusedtesla.com.
  - Talked to two folks who could scrape the CPO (certified pre-owned tesla) data from tesla's website.
- Hypothesis:
  - People actually want to lease their cars.
  - Test: deal with a tesla lease partner
  - Found ev-vin.blogspot.com
