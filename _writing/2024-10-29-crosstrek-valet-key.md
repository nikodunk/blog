It's taken me 4 years of owning a Subaru Crosstrek to finally find out how to take my valet key surfing without a radio bag. I couldn't find it in the manual, on Youtube, or online. I was questioning Subaru's "outdoorsy" image, but I guess they did actually build it in:

- You hold the lock button for 2 seconds
- you then simultaneously press the unlock (subaru starcluster logo) button
- Your key fob is now off, you can remove the valet key, and place your fob into the car without a radio bag.
- You press any button on the fob to turn the fob back on.

Happy surfing.
