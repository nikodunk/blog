It's taken me 4 years of owning a Subaru Crosstrek to work out how to take my valet key surfing without putting the fob into a radio bag (so that the fob in the car doesn't just keep the car unlocked). This is a key feature for people who transport water sports gear with their Subaru (as their ads would like to suggest they're built for), yet couldn't find it in the manual, on Youtube, or online.

Though extremely well-hidden, this feature does exist. I eventually found [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/rvUemRS2g2M?si=x0uTz6CE4sYLFrCd&t=415s) - the only place I ever have seen it mentioned.

- You hold the lock button
- you then simultaneously double-press (!) the unlock button (Subaru starcluster logo)
- Your key fob is now off, you can remove the valet key, and place your fob into the car without a radio bag.
- You press any button on the fob to turn the fob back on.

Happy surfing.
