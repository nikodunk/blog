This is [PostmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org) running on a Snapdragon 845 in an unlocked 2018 Oneplus 6 I bought used on eBay for $85. This is the Gnome Shell w/ mobile patches variant, which has not been fully upstreamed yet into Gnome main: [Towards Gnome Shell on Mobile](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2022/09/09/gnome-shell-on-mobile-an-update/).
