How I discovered centrism through open-source software, or: how the US political parties map to linux distributions.

I recently switched to Linux full-time, and started some low-key contributions mainly to documentation, testing and the new Fedora website. I made had some realizations in the process on conservativism vs. progressivism in the open-source scene. Specifically, in the different approaches that different open-source Linux distributions take to their packaging:

Arch <=> left-wing Progressivism:

- Sometimes too far forward-looking and unstable.
- City experiments.
- Dismantling capitalism.

Debian Stable <=> Conservativism:

    - People wanting the past and getting frustrated at progress.
    - Fearful of breakage leads to paralysis.
    - Not trusting leadership to progress while listening to their needs.

Fedora <=> balanced Centrism

    - The "centrist" approach of balancing the above two methods yields a sensible inbetween.
    - Communities thrive when right compromise of progress and stability.
    - Ubuntu used to be in this position and pushed the community forward for a decade, but then chased shiny objects due to a missing business model.
    - Democracy at its best.
