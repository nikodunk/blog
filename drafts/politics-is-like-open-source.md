How I discovered centrism through open-source software.
How the US political parties map to linux distributions.

Arch <> Left:

    - Too far forward-looking and unstable.
    - City experiments.
    - Dismantling capitalism.

Debian <> Right:

    - People wanting the past and getting frustrated at progress.
    - Fearful of breakage leads them to dig in.
    - Not trusting other side to progress while listening to their needs.

Fedora <> Democracy at its best.

    - Sensible inbetween.
    - Communities thrive when right compromise of progress and stability.
    - Ubuntu used to be in this position and pushed the community forward for a decade, but then chased shiny objects due to a missing business model.
