January 2019
===

Here is an update for the January month at paperwork labs. See last month's [here](/startup-updates-2) including cofounder, MVP, grant funding. As a reminder, we've pivoted from solving medical note-taking to solving medical paperwork. We are building "Turbotax for Medical Forms".


KPIs
----
* We are default dead
* Paying customers: 0
* MRR: $0
* Net MRR growth: 0%
* Customer churn: 0%
* Team: 2 people
* Cash: $15,000 in bank
* Monthly burn: $2,500


Key Events
----------
Good
====
* We're currently talking to 5 potential practices/networks, totalling 220 practices total and trying to get a paying customer by Feb 1: First sending them last month's demo video, then showing them a live demo on a call. 2/5 still interested after demo. 
* Main push-backs from demo calls: No EMR integration, price (we were asking $99/form/practice/month), and "let me run this by the other practices". 
* So we're offering a 5 forms included in the plan (this was the plan anyway), have a call to integrate with an EMR called ECW, and are offering a trial license with just 1 practice (getting buy-in from 20 is hard at once).
* Product: Built demo-able mock "Turbotax for medical forms" with 1 working form incl. PDF export, persistent data. Still needs user login, more forms, EMR integration, actual reporting dashboard (currently static page).

Bad
===
* The sales cycle is quite long – 4 weeks for a first client.

Asks
----
* Intros to practices struggling with form overload.
* Intros to investors with experience in the medical software space for advice.
* Advice on building out healthcare SaaS products.
* We're looking for free/cheap office space for one or two, please! We were doing spacious.com, but it's a little lonely.
