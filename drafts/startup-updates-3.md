Hi! I'm looking for advice on building out medical SaaS products.

We're currently talking to 3 potential users with my cofounder, and first showing them our demo video, and then showing them a live demo on the call.

---

Help Wanted/Asks:
* Intros to practices struggling with form overload

Hiring/Funding: 
* Found Co-Founder Mitul (medical software sales professional with 6 years of exprience in industry).
* Received Grant from Emergent Ventures with possible follow-up grant – they agreed that "solving the paperwork problem in healthcare" is a problem worth solving – which extended runway from 15 to 19 months at current burn.

KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Had 3 calls with users in funnel – pilot with 10 LA practices at $99/mo.
* Sent out over 200 emails to qualified candidates showing demo video.
* Digitized 2 forms for demo

Product:
* New concept: "Turbotax for medical forms".
* Digitized first 2 paper forms into smart form form demo, incl. online reporting dashboard.
* Made demo video of prototype @ paperworklabs.com

Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* Big enough problem so can get 10 practices to pay $99/month by Feb 1st, by showing video/demo.
* Big enough problem to reach 100M ARR with US physicians alone (230'000 physician practices in the US)

Objective / Key Results for next 2 weeks:
* Integration with first EHR, if the client gives green-light. Hipaa compliance of user data.
* First paying customer pilot.

Execution Strategy/OKRs for more details:
