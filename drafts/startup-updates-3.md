Key Events
----------
Good
====
* We've talked to 5 practice groups this month, added 1 new one today alone, and have verbal order with one practice the largest practice group for 6 licenses (6 * $99). We're presenting to 20 more practices from the same practice group on Feb 27th. 
* Product: This was all done with a video of the product (see last month), and remote demos over Skype. Why? We've built demo-able mock "Turbotax for medical forms" with 1 working form incl. PDF export, persistent data. Still needs user login, more forms, EMR integration, actual reporting dashboard (currently static page). Now that we have first customer signed on we're going to build this. An intial 
* Learnings: From push-backs from the sales calls we've learned that the down-sides are: No EMR integration (had a call with EMR, they're holding the data hostage, but the first customer STILL signed on and many are interested regardless), price (we were asking $99/form/practice/month ... this was too much), and "let me run this by the other practices". We began offering 5 forms for $99 (build once, run anywhere), and offered that as a limited time offer until last Friday â€“Â this was too sweet a deal, which moved the first practice over the finish line.
* We started working on this new concept on December 10th, had a prototype ready by December 18th, and had our first customer demo Jan 8th. We have a verbal sign-on incl. pricing Jan 23rd.

Bad

* We had a call with an EMR â€“Â not possible to integrate. They're holding the customer's healthcare data hostage. Upside: Customers subscribed anyway.
* A LOT of work to do now ðŸš€
