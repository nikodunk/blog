Week 1:
quickly followed up with all contacts from job to let them know what i'm working on
incorporated LLC with stripe atlas (more like aside project currently but don't want liability), Did health insurance, worked from friends' office.
built subscription, built 60-sec dictation.

Week 2:
Spent weekend and Monday with a friend doctor and original user to learn more and think of features.
In dedicated office – spacious.com
Asking for intros to physicians.
First subscriber! Emailed the hell out of her. Ran the friends' feature by her on Friday – creating a billable PDF note. She liked so building it.


Week 3:
Really hitting stride. Work from spacious (gets me out of home for $129/mo). Talking to Users and Writing code.
Asking for intros to physicians.
Shipped first differentiated version Monday (dictate / create PDF billable note)
Sales slow though. Grind. Emailing users, writing features for them.
Enough physician interviews that know not physicians (process of elimination). My one paying customer is acupuncturist – maybe that's it. Talking to dentists and psychotherapists too.

Week 4:
New sign-ups stopped. User week necessary.
Physicially going to acupuncturists and signing them up. 
Asking for intros to acupuncturists, psychotherapists and dentists.
Second sign-up! Now 2 paying users.
Founder recommended I start fundraising with proto + users.
