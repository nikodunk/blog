An archived version of the final website (started as Paper, ended up being called Smoke) before we switched it off is <a href="http://nikodunk.github.io/smoke/">here</a>.


Cofounder Cofounder Cofounder. Team Team Team. I can't stress this enough, and is the main point of learning I've brought. 

Hardware is hard. There's a reason that so many founders these days (especially young ones) started with a software project – there's no overhead and you can pivot infinite times without the sunk-cost-fallacy that hardware and minimums bring.

Hair-on-fire problem (vitamins vs. painkillers).

Give yourself enough time. The chances that you'll find something that takes off withing 6 months is very minimal. Even if you do find something great, traction takes time. Word of mouth and actual revenue takes time. Make sure you have runway for multiple pivots. We had time for 2 pivots in retrospect (from cardboard to CNC milled furniture to high-end furniture), and found out that the second product was the one that sold best. We'd have needed more time to react to this.

Get initial, free traction. This comes off the last point – is there a business case? Do your unit economics work? Do an initial test.
