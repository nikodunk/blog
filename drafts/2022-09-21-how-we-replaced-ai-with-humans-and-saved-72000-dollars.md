While most companies are busy at work trying to replace humans with some form of automation or AI, this is the story of how ATMOS replaced an AI fraud prediction solution with simple dashboard to make human decision making as efficient as possible.

We too had the option of doing what most fintech startups do, and buying in to a fraud-prevention vendor - after all if it's their bread-and-butter to prevent fraud, they'll probably be better at it than we are, right? Well, we tried it at first of course. But we quickly received a few unpredicted "exceptions" that cost us dearly. One is too many. So, while everyone else ran in the opposite direction, we decided instead of going all-in on 3rd party anti-fraud AI vendors - we built a dashboard to make human decisioning as efficient as possible.

This method was inspired by an article by the Bearblog founder Herman's article ["From 5 hours to 15 minutes per week"](https://herman.bearblog.dev/5-hours-to-15-minutes/).

It not only saved anywhere from $72,000-100,000+ depending on estimation methods in the process, but also outperformed the comnpetition that either a) didn't have fraud prediction/prevention or b) used ineffective AI fraud prevention vendors. This is proven by the fact that a some of them have had to throttle or close new applications due to fraud, while we have not.

Instead of building a 99% precise self-driving car, we have found success in a building a 100% precise, very efficient bicycle. It won't scale to 1B users, but it doesn't have to - it got us to the next step.
