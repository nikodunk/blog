While most companies are busy at work trying to replace humans with some form of automation or AI, this is the story of how we at Atmos replaced an AI fraud prediction solution (Socure) with humans + software. This method was inspired by an article by the Bearblog founder Herman's article ["From 5 hours to 15 minutes per week"](https://herman.bearblog.dev/5-hours-to-15-minutes/)) and not only saved anywhere from $72,000-100,000+ depending on estimation methods in the process, but also outperformed the comnpetition that either a) didn't have fraud prediction/prevention or b) used ineffective AI (proven by the fact that a lot of them have had to throttle or close new applications due to fraud, while we have not).

Instead of building a bad self-driving car, we have found success in a very efficient bicycle.
