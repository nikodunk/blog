February 2019
===
We lost the client. We pivoted the product and re-used the same health contacts. We're very far away from the original goal of the company at this point, so we started something anew with the learnings from the first 4 months...


KPIs
----
* We are default dead
* Paying customers: 0
* MRR: $0
* Net MRR growth: %0
* Customer churn: %0
* Team: 2 people
* Cash: $35,000 in bank
* Monthly burn: $2,500


Key Events
----------
Bad
===
* Lost first client again, due to them wanting a (technically nearly impossible) integration with their existing EMR provider. The EMR provider wouldn't play ball.


Good
====
* Came up with new healthcare SaaS concept, and had 7 calls with the same clients.
* Additionally started working on side project Electrade – the world's first electric vehicle marketplace.


Asks
----
* None while we sort our stuff out, thankyouverymuch.
