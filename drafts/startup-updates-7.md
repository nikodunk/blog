# Experiments/Hypothesis run:
* ### Problem: Not installing app (acquisition). Attempts to solve:
	* Paid Reddit paid on /r/electricvehicles and /r/teslamotors
		*  **Results:** $0.45 per tap Android and $0.49 on iOS. Roughly 50% install rate from product page -> Roughly $1 per install.


* ### Problem: Installed, not a single person even opened Stripe CC screen.
	* Trust
		* Clearer onboarding process. More trustworthy
		* Polish, so app seems less sketchy


* ### Problem: Money.
	* Test Concierge service (you say which car, we'll find at a price).
	* Test Consultant service (we'll answer your EV questions and then recommend products).
	* Change from pure EV? Potentially, the hassle-free value proposition may be more effective in a mainstream market for now?
	* Add off-lease cars from Greenlight Auto Wholesale ?
	* Help find parking spots with charging for those EV owners without a garage w/ Piedparker.com ?
	* Rent an EV for a month between leases?

	* With Armin: Add-ons/Benefits over lease like on Fair, but WITHOUT the car lease? For EV owners who already have a car. Benefits package. Add leases again later once we're the AAA of EVs.



### Experiments for next 2 weeks:
