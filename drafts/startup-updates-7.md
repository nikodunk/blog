# Hiring:Â

# KPIs/Core Metrics:
* Monthly Active Users: 270
* Weekly Active Users: 100
* Daily Active Users: 13-40
* Lease requests: 12
* Lease requests per day: 1-2
* Lease conversions: 0
* Lease conversion revenue: $0

# Product:
* Added polish
* Made up-front reservation fee default. Clearer to test value for now.
* Tested test-drives
* Removed insurance
* Added value-add club

# Experiments/Hypothesis run:

* ### Problem: Not one user opened Stripe Credit Card screen to lease car. Possible Solutions:
	* More trustworthy seeming interace help?
		* Clearer onboarding process. More trustworthy
		* Polish, so app seems less sketchy
		* Results: One stripe open, still no checkouts.
	* Value-add to differentiate (Fair has "cancel any time" and "bundled insurance")
		* New cofounder Amir suggested we try a value-add add-ons/Benefits on top of lease to differentiate ourselves from normal leasing lke Fair's "Cancel any time"?
		* Results: No difference.
	* And what if could sell unbundled from car lease, too?

* ### Experiment: Maybe easier to sell value-add features separately, without the car leasing.
	* $35 per month value-add benefits EV bundle (pivot)
	* Add leases again later once we're the AAA of EVs. 
	* Upside: Address _whole_ EV market, not just subset actively looking for EV lease.
	* Upside: Less friction due to 1 month instead of 36 month commitment. $35 commitment instead of $8,000 comittment for lease.
	* Advertise new value prop through paid marketing. If we can get 10 people to pay $35 in the next week we'll pivot.
		* Reddit Results: 18 clicks for $8 -> 5 installs ($1.6 per install) -> 5 people touched through to pricing -> 0 subscribers
		* iOS Results: 

Experiment backlog:
* Test Concierge service (you say which car, we'll find at a price).
* Test Consultant service (we'll answer your EV questions and then recommend products).
* Change from pure EV? Potentially, the hassle-free value proposition may be more effective in a mainstream market for now?
* Add off-lease cars from Greenlight Auto Wholesale ?
* Help find parking spots with charging for those EV owners without a garage w/ Piedparker.com ?
* Rent an EV for a month between leases?

### Experiments for next 2 weeks:
